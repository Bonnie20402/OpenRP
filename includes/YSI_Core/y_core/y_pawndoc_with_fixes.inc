/**
	<hidden />
	<remarks>
		This variable only exists to re-show other variables.  It ends a tiny
		comment in the output XML started by fixes.inc with the immediately
		preceeding variable (which should be called
		<c>ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZY</c>) so that we can document several
		seemingly "internal" variables that are actually for end-user use
		(<c>_0</c> - <c>_9</c>).  We then re-start the block comment to have it
		ended again later by the original fixes.inc end variable
		(<c>_zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy</c>).  This only works because the
		fixes.inc function of the same name as this variable is in a different
		scope, and so fixes.inc also needed to use a different name for its
		hiding variable since all its variables are in the same scope.
		<p />
		Note that the actual hiding itself is done by an XML comment started
		earlier and ended here.
	</remarks>
